A brief install guide derived from the official ROS Wiki resides [here](https://github.com/RoboticsClubIITK/2019_winter_camp/blob/complete/ROS/ROS%20INSTALLATION.pdf).

Slides and Assignments inspired and derived from the ETH-Zurich course Programming for Robotics ([link](https://rsl.ethz.ch/education-students/lectures/ros.html))

[talker_listener](https://github.com/ros/ros_tutorials/tree/melodic-devel/roscpp_tutorials), [turtlesim](https://github.com/ros/ros_tutorials/tree/melodic-devel/turtlesim) and [teleop_twist_keyboard](https://github.com/ros-teleop/teleop_twist_keyboard) are borrowed from official ROS tutorials, used for in-lecture walkthroughs.
